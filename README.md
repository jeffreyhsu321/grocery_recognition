#### Convolutional Neural Networks (and more) for
# Produce Recognition
---

This computer vision project aims to develop models that are capable of recognizing and labeling raw food in pictures taken at groceries stores.

We plan to integrate this functionality as a mobile feature for our [Recipes Generator](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398f23klingons/recipes-repo/src/master/).

### PLEASE REFER TO `Report.ipynb` FOR THE FULL REPORT

Additional Jupyter Notebooks are located in `./notebooks`. These are used to develop the models that are illustrated in the report.

Each of the notebooks are referred to and linked properly through the Report, so **reading just the Report is sufficient** to cover all the material prepared in this project.
